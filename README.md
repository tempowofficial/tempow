# Tempow Smart Contracts
There are two smart contracts in Tempow UTO, which are interrelated: Tempow Token and Tempow Controller. Tempow Token represents a basic ERC20 token with mintable, ownable and related functionalities. Tempow Controller relies on token and it is responsible for token distribution aspects of UTO platform. Both smart contracts are going to be deployed up front, but they are actually going to be used after UTO finishes, to be able to distribute tokens.
